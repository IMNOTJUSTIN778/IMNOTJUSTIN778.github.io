    <h2 class="jersey-15-regular"></h2class>Week 2</h2>
    <h3><p>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</p>
        <h4>I was first attracted by its visual design, the summer atmosphere and relaxing music created by the website instantly transported me to the ENDLESS SUMMER environment.</h4>
    <h3><p>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</p>
        <h4>Visit the website
            Observe the visual elements and layout of the home page
            Read the introductory text on the home page
            Interact with the interactive elements on the page: zoom in and out of the page size
            Slowly scrolling back through the content via the navigation menu
            </h4>
    <h3><p>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</p>
        <h4>I mostly spend my time enjoying the rich visual content and some of the interactions on the page
        </h4>
    <h3><p>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</p>
        <h4>The most common action is probably to click on the navigation elements and explore the timeline background provided by the website</h4>
    <h3><p>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</p>
        <h4>Showcasing the key lifestyles of brand holders, attracting and retaining the interest of potential customers by providing an immersive visual experience</h4>
    <h3><p>6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</p>
        <h4>At first I didn't realize it was an advertisement for a watch until I paid attention to the headline, which presented the time change and the dial-like design of the navigation bar tantalizingly led the consumer's interest until it was finally revealed to be a watch promotion</h4>
    <h3><p>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</p>
        <h4>It can attract customers to watch the advertisement repeatedly by changing the movement of each time with different changes.</h4>
    <h3><p>8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</p></h3>
    <h4>it can choose to advertise again, and changing the most prominent part of the cover may be able to make customers interested again.
       </h4>

    <h2 class="jersey-15-regular"></h2class>Week 3</h2>
    <h3><p>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</p>
        <h4>What attracts me most about this web design is the game-like interaction, each stage brought to me gives me the feeling of encountering a new world, and creates a great curiosity about what is going to happen. (Scene changes due to time shifting)
        </h4>
    <h3><p>10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</p>
        <h4>Interacts in a sophisticated and nuanced way that emphasizes thematic contexts
        </h4>
    <h3><p>11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</p>
        <h4>High-end visual design and professional content layout aim to convey a luxurious, exclusive feeling that makes users feel unique to the brand.</h4>
    <h3><p>12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</p>
        <h4>It can only be viewed in a small viewing window, and once you zoom in it changes back to the cover, which is not very friendly for computer users
        </h4>
    <h3><p>13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</p></h3>
    <h4>High-quality images and videos, and a well-designed user experience. Methodical interface interactions and relaxing themes and music</h4>
